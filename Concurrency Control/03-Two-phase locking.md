### Two-Phase Locking
* Two-phase locking (2PL) is a concurrency control protocol that prevents deadlocks in databases.
* It works by dividing the execution of a transaction into two phases.
    * Lock acquisition phase: In this phase, the transaction acquires all the locks that it needs to complete its execution.
    * Lock release phase: In this phase, the transaction releases all the locks that it holds.
